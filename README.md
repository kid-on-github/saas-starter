# SAAS Starter

This is a React/Cloudflare project starter to lower the barrier to entry on new projects.

The starter includes the following features:
- [x] Typescript (React, Cloudflare Functions, etc.)
- [x] Google social sign in (with Firebase as the auth provider)
- [x] Cloudflare Functions for serverless functions
- [ ] React Query for data fetching and caching
- [ ] Pre-built *Join the Waitlist* functionality
- [ ] Google Analytics integration
- [ ] User management (and impersonation) system
- [ ] Production deployment to Cloudflare
- [ ] Automated feature branch deployments
- [ ] Paypal integration

## Getting Started

### Set up Firebase

1. Create a new Firebase project.
2. Make sure to enable the Google sign-in method in the Firebase console.

### Run the project locally

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Copy the `firebase/config.example.ts` file to `firebase/config.ts` and fill out the required fields (these fields come from your Firebase project).
3. Run the project with `npx wrangler pages dev -- npx react-scripts start`.

The frontend can be accessed by going to [http://localhost:8788/](http://localhost:8788/).

You can verify that the backend is running by going to [http://127.0.0.1:8788/api/hello](http://127.0.0.1:8788/api/hello).

## Authentication

Authentication is handled with Firebase. Currently the only way to sign in is with Google's social sign in. If you need to make an authenticated request to the backend, you can pass the token to the backend and it'll be verified by the Cloudflare backend.

## Styling

Currently module-based styling is recommended. Google's Material Icons have been imported from in the root `index.html` file, so they are globally available.
